    select_projection_strategy(block_sizes, projection_types) -> Symbol

Select the GPU hierarchy used to project a collection of cone blocks.  The
return value is one of `:gridWise`, `:blockWise`, `:warpWise`, or
`:threadWise`.

`block_sizes` and `projection_types` use the solver's complete block layout.
The first two blocks are scalar/simple cones in that layout, so only entries
from the third block onward determine the largest structured-cone dimension.

The rule is fitted from same-input grid/block/warp/thread measurements in
`benchmark/R3.5/projection_benchmark`. Mixed cone families and RSOC use the robust
block mapping. For pure SOC layouts, dimensions 1--4 favor a thread, 5--64 a
warp, dimensions 65--1023 switch from block to warp near 1,000 cones, and
dimensions at least 1024 favor a block. A single SOC switches from block to
the grid implementation at dimension 32768. The small-SOC high-count crossover
is handled separately because warp occupancy eventually costs more than doing
the short reduction in one thread.

For controlled end-to-end A/B experiments, `PDCS_PROJECTION_STRATEGY_OVERRIDE`
may be set to `grid`, `block`, `warp`, or `thread`.  It is intentionally unset
in production runs, where the measured automatic rule below is used.
